AI Security Risk Assessment

Scope & Purpose
Focuses on identifying security risks in AI systems.
Highlights vulnerabilities from development → deployment → operational use.
Goal: provide a framework for organizations to assess, mitigate, and monitor risks.

Major Risk Categories

Data Risks
Data poisoning and manipulation.
Leakage of sensitive training data.
Biases embedded into AI outputs.

Model Risks
Model theft or extraction.
Adversarial attacks (evasion, perturbations).
Backdoors in pre-trained models.

System/Operational Risks
Insecure APIs and integrations.
Misconfigured infrastructure (cloud/Kubernetes).
Inadequate monitoring of agentic/autonomous AI systems.

Governance & Compliance Risks
Lack of explainability and traceability.
Gaps in accountability for AI-driven decisions.
Non-compliance with AI regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF).

Supply Chain & Third-Party Risks
Risks from open-source AI components.
Vulnerabilities in third-party APIs, plugins, or datasets.
Potential for cascading failures via vendor ecosystems.


Mitigation Strategies

Data Security: enforce data provenance, validation, and monitoring pipelines.
Model Protection: adversarial training, watermarking, access control on models.
System Hardening: API security, zero-trust architecture, runtime monitoring.
Governance: clear accountability, human-in-the-loop controls, audit logging.
Supply Chain Security: dependency scanning, vendor risk assessments, sandboxing integrations.


Risk Assessment Approach
Use risk scoring frameworks aligned with NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001.
Evaluate likelihood vs. impact for each AI risk.
Apply continuous red teaming and stress testing to validate defenses.

Key Takeaways

AI introduces unique risks beyond traditional IT systems.
Agentic/autonomous AI creates unpredictable behaviors that challenge security perimeters.
Organizations must treat AI security as integral to overall cybersecurity strategy, not an afterthought.
Continuous monitoring, governance, and regulatory compliance are essential pillars for secure AI adoption.
