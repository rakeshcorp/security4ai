MAESTRO Threat Modeling Framework for Agentic AI

1. Purpose

MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment, Security, Threat Risk, and Outcome) is a proposed framework for threat modeling in Agentic AI.
It expands on existing threat modeling methods (STRIDE, PASTA, LINDDUN) with AI-specific considerations.

2. MAESTRO Principles

Extended Security Categories – includes adversarial ML, autonomy risks, and AI-specific threats.
Multi-Agent & Environment Focus – considers agent-to-agent and agent-to-environment interactions.
Layered Security – security integrated into each architectural layer.
Risk-Based Approach – prioritization of threats by likelihood and impact.
Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation – ongoing threat intelligence, model updates, and observability.

3. Seven-Layer Reference Architecture

MAESTRO models threats across 7 layers of Agentic AI:

Foundation Models – core AI/LLM models
Threats: adversarial examples, model stealing, backdoors, membership inference, poisoning, reprogramming, DoS.

Data Operations – storage, pipelines, retrieval systems
Threats: poisoning, exfiltration, tampering, DoS, compromised RAG pipelines.

Agent Frameworks – libraries and development toolkits
Threats: supply chain attacks, backdoors, compromised components, DoS on APIs, input validation attacks.

Deployment & Infrastructure – cloud/on-prem environments
Threats: container compromises, orchestration attacks (e.g., Kubernetes), IaC manipulation, DoS, resource hijacking, lateral movement.

Evaluation & Observability – monitoring and metrics
Threats: poisoned metrics, compromised observability tools, DoS, evasion, data leakage through logs, poisoning observability data.

Security & Compliance (Vertical Layer) – spans all layers
Threats: data poisoning of security agents, adversarial evasion, compromised AI security agents, regulatory non-compliance, bias, lack of explainability, model extraction.

Agent Ecosystem – interaction with real-world apps/users
Threats: malicious/impersonated agents, agent goal manipulation, misuse of tools, marketplace manipulation, integration/API risks, repudiation, compromised registries, pricing manipulation, misleading capability descriptions.

4. Cross-Layer Threats

Supply Chain Attacks – one compromised layer (e.g., framework) affects others.
Lateral Movement – attackers pivot across infrastructure layers.
Privilege Escalation – unauthorized privilege gains propagate across layers.
Data Leakage – exposure across multiple layers.
Goal Misalignment Cascades – poisoned data or manipulated goals propagating through ecosystems.

5. Mitigation Strategies

Layer-Specific – controls tailored to individual layers.
Cross-Layer – defense-in-depth, secure inter-layer communication, monitoring, incident response.

AI-Specific

Adversarial training
Formal verification for alignment
Explainable AI (XAI) for auditability
Red teaming & safety monitoring

6. MAESTRO Step-by-Step Approach

System Decomposition – map agents, capabilities, goals, interactions.
Layer-Specific Threat Modeling – apply threats per architecture layer.
Cross-Layer Threat Identification – analyze cascading effects.
Risk Assessment – likelihood + impact prioritization.
Mitigation Planning – implement targeted controls.
Implementation & Monitoring – continuous updates and monitoring.

7. Agentic Architecture Patterns & Risks

Single-Agent Pattern
Threat: goal manipulation
Mitigation: input validation, restricted parameter access

Multi-Agent Pattern
Threats: channel interception, identity attacks
Mitigation: secure comms, authentication, validation

Unconstrained Conversational Autonomy
Threat: prompt injection/jailbreaking
Mitigation: robust input filters, safety filters

Task-Oriented Agents
Threat: DoS via overload
Mitigation: rate limiting, load balancing

Hierarchical Agents
Threat: compromise of higher-level agent to control subordinates
Mitigation: access controls, secure comms, monitoring

Distributed Ecosystem
Threat: Sybil attacks (fake agents)
Mitigation: identity/reputation systems

Human-in-the-Loop Collaboration
Threat: manipulation of human feedback
Mitigation: audit trails, input validation

Self-Learning/Adaptive Agents
Threat: poisoning with backdoor triggers
Mitigation: data sanitization, strong training data validation

8. Key Takeaways

MAESTRO provides a comprehensive AI threat modeling framework spanning technical, operational, and ecosystem risks.
It integrates layered security, continuous monitoring, and AI-specific defenses.
Supports both systematic risk assessment and practical mitigations for complex agentic ecosystems.
